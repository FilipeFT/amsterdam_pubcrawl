A reflection on the Amsterdam pub scene history

I have found a guide book of Amsterdam pubs from the 1970s.

It made me curious: which pubs in the city, open at the moment, are also represented in this guide from half a century ago?

So I decided to investigate! Current plan is to publish the reports here in markdown and use Huge to create a static website.

Stay tunned!
