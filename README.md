A reflection on the Amsterdam pub scene history

I have found a guide book of Amsterdam pubs from the 1970s: "Groot Amsterdams Kroegenboek", by Ben Ten Holter.

Published for the first time in 1977 by Tiesbosch Produktie- & Uitgeversmaatschappij BV, it is an interesting historical piece.

Several pubs, bars and cafes serving beers and snacks in the city were visited, evaluated and the highlights presented in friendly, banter-y prose.

It made me curious: which pubs in the city, open at the moment, are also represented in this guide from half a century ago?

So I decided to investigate! Current plan is to publish the reports here in markdown and use Hugo to create a static website.

Stay tunned!
